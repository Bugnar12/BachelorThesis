  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Gmail Phishing Detector</strong> is a Chrome extension that analyzes Gmail emails for potential phishing threats. We take your privacy seriously.</p>

  <h2>What Data Is Collected</h2>
  <p>This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. It only analyzes the content of the currently opened Gmail email in your browser tab, and sends necessary content (like email body and URLs) to a secure backend server for phishing detection.</p>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>The data analyzed is used solely to detect phishing attempts. No data is stored permanently. The extension does not access any data outside of Gmail unless explicitly authorized by you.</p>

  <h2>Third-party Services</h2>
  <p>This extension communicates with a backend API hosted at <code>bachelorthesis-production-8acf.up.railway.app</code> for phishing detection. No data is shared with advertisers or analytics providers.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The extension requests access to Gmail tabs and limited browser APIs strictly for functionality. No unnecessary permissions are used.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a></p>
